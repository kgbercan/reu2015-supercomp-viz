[i]Melete features several interactive face nodes in addition to the head node. These are a combination of dynamic screens, passive printed visuals, addressable LEDs, and other interactive elements. They are planned to be placed in labs, meeting spaces, and classrooms both at CCT and elsewhere on LSU campus to give interactive control of the machine to authorized users.

Five research domains are expected to benefit from Melete – computational biology, materials, mathematics, engineering, and arts.[/i]
